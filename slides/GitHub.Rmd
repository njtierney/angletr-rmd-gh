- Facilitates working collaboratively on big software projects

# Why Github?

- So, what is Git__Hub__?

- From Hadley Wickham's [R packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/git.html ), GitHub is ...

> ... A website that allows you to share your code with the world, solicit improvements via pull requests and track issues. 

> Have your ever tried to collaboratively write code with someone by sending files back and forth via email or a Dropbox folder? It takes a lot of effort just to make sure that the two of you aren’t working on the same file and overwriting each others’ changes. With Git, both of you can work on the same file at the same time. Git will either combine your changes automatically, or it will show you all the ambiguities and conflicts.

# Notes on using GitHub

- Privacy:
  - put things that you want to ignore in the `.gitignore` file
    - private data
    - images
    - large files
- NEVER commit anything to GitHub in a public repository you don't want to share, unless it is Private.
- Horror story of passwords being stolen

# Using GitHug Issues and Pull Requests: The next level

- issues can be used to log ideas, bugs, or even discussions
  - [rOpenSci unconf](https://github.com/ropensci/unconf17/issues)
  - [rOpenSci onboarding](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/issues/127)
  - [datapasta](https://github.com/MilesMcBain/datapasta/issues/42)
  - [datapasta](https://github.com/MilesMcBain/datapasta/issues/26)
- These can then be used on project boards
  - [narnia](https://github.com/njtierney/narnia/projects/2)
  - [dplyr](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/projects/3)
- pull requests to share and collaborate
  - [rOpenSci](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/pull/122)
  - [dplyr](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/pull/2717)

# Going further with GitHub

- RStudio provides a nice interface, but it can be limiting in some ways
- I highly recommend SourceTree or GitKraken for managing Git
- They ahve very good tools for managing merge conflicts (when there are some changes that need to be manually added).
- Other information here in Jenny Bryan's book: http://happygitwithr.com/git-client.html
